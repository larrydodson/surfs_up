## Overview 
  
  We are planning to open a new surf and ice cream shop in Oahu Hawaii, a "Surf and Shake Shop". The new business' primary investor, W. Avy, is requesting an analysis of the weather (precipitation and temperatures), on Oahu as part of the due diligence based on location to predict the probable success of the business. And if successful, to use the same approach and code when possibly expanding to other locations. W. Avy has provided weather data from the island from multiple locations, and includes temperatures and precipitation measurements for the years 2010 through 2017, and this will be used for the analysis. 

   ### Purpose
   To prepare an analysis of precipitation data over the past 12 months for Oahu Hawaii, in the months of June and December from 2010 through 2017, in order to assist in a business decision to open a "Surf & Shake Shop" on the island. The analysis will help with understanding and predicting a successful outcome for traffic at the shop, to determine if this business is sustainable year-round. The deliverables are: 
   - Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
   - Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
   - Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (This Report). 
  
   

   ### Resources
  * Data sources: hawaii.sqlite file
  * Software: Windows10, Python 3.8.3, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code 1.49.1, SQLite database
