## Overview 
  
  We are planning to open a new surf and ice cream shop in Oahu Hawaii, a "Surf and Shake" shop. The new business' primary investor, W. Avy, is requesting an analysis of the weather on Oahu as part of the due diligence to predict the probable success of the business in this location. And if successful, to use the same approach when possibly expanding to other locations. We have weather data from the island from multiple locations that W. Avy has provided, and it includes temperatures and precipitation measurements for the past several years, this will be used in the analysis. 

   ### Purpose
   To prepare an analysis of weather data over the past 12 months for Oahu Hawaii, specifically for temperatures and precipitations, in order to assist in a business decision to open a "Surf & Shake Shop" on the island. The analysis will help with understanding and predicting a successful outcome for traffic at the shop. The deliverables are these: 
   - Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June
   - Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December
   - Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (This report) 
  
   

   ### Resources
  * Data sources: hawaii.sqlite file
  * Software: Windows10, Python 3.8.3, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Jupyter Notebook, VS Code 1.49.1, SQLite database
